### [Build a complete machine learning pipeline in scikit-learn](https://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-Toronto/events/262643266/)

This final pipeline will provide a robust and effective way to complete all the steps of a machine learning workflow in just a single line of code. Scikit-learn has many new tools to help streamline and automate this process.

A full tutorial will be available at the following Dunder Data Github page: https://github.com/DunderData/Data-Science-Tutorials/tree/master/Machine%20Learning/Build%20a%20Complete%20Machine%20Learning%20Pipeline%20with%20scikit-learn

This is an intermediate/advanced tutorial and you will need to have prerequisite knowledge of python and the scikit-learn library to follow the tutorial.

Please make sure you have Python installed with all the common data science libraries. See my tutorial on setting up a robust data science environment in Python: https://medium.com/dunder-data/anaconda-is-bloated-set-up-a-lean-robust-data-science-environment-with-miniconda-and-conda-forge-b48e1ac11646
