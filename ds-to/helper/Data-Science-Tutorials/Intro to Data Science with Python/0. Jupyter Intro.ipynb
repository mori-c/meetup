If the last line of code in your cell produces any output, then this value will be displayed in the **`Out`** cell directly below it. If your last line of code produces no output, then there will be no **`Out`** cell. Run the following cell by pressing **shift** + **enter**\n",

    "* **Keras** - High level, easy to use deep learning library\n",
    "* **Tensorflow** - High performance computing, most notable for use in deep learning\n",
