# Introduction to Data Visualization with Python
In this [Houston Data Science][1] meetup we will cover the Matplotlib Python visualization library. It has a number of quirks that make it more difficult to learn that other libraries in the data science stack.

# Install Python 3 on your own BEFORE coming to class
Follow the tutorial in the [Intro to Python][2] repository in order to install the Anaconda distribution with Python 3.

# Agenda
* Understanding the Figure/Axes hierarchy of Matplotlib
* Matplotlib's dual interface - Choosing the object-oriented vs the stateful interface
* Setting up the Figure and all the Axes to work with the object-oriented approach
* Using the plot method and understanding how to change the default attributes
* An overview of the most popular other plotting methods
* Drilling into the plot objects and examining their methods and attributes
* Animating an NBA Game
* Other visualization libraries such as Seaborn, Bokeh, and Plotly

## Jupyter Notebook
All work for this tutorial will take place within a Jupyter Notebook
